<h1>About the App</h1>


SEED integrates real-time soil sensing with AI-driven decision-making to provide personalized crop recommendations, fertilizer suggestions, disease detection, irrigation advice, and natural language conversational support.

The system is powered by an Espressif Systems 32-bit microcontroller (ESP32) and employs machine learning models trained on both live and historical datasets to deliver actionable insights directly to the farmer’s mobile device.

Through the integration of the Google Gemini API, advanced features such as chatbot interaction, image-based disease detection, and adaptive irrigation recommendations are enabled.

A cross-platform mobile application, developed using Flutter, supports multilingual functionality and offline-first capabilities to ensure usability in areas with limited connectivity.
